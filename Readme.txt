TaperCalc: Medicine Taper calc and schedule creator

To open unzip the folder and double click TaperCalc application
Follow the prompts and respond. 
right now you have to copy and paste the generated taper plan/schedule to a text file or whatever to save it. I have pasted it to google keep for easy access.
If the program hits a dead end or crashes just exit and restart, I have tried to anticipate issues validating user input but who knows!
Any questions or suggestions find me on reddit u/WillzyxandOnandOn or respond here https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/o92g61/i_made_a_simple_c_console_program_that_will/
